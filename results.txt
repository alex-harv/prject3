Part 1: <CSEL-W103-54>

	Explain your results (2-3 sentences):
	There was alot of variation in the time it would take. Expecially if the first access didnt happen.
	But by looking at the minimum time for a non-access, you could set a threshold. It was found that while 
	non access times would often be 400-500, the lowest they would usually be seen was 350, while access times
	did not usually get that high.
	
	Calculated threshold: 350
	This threshold did work, provided that the test was run many times and the most common result was the secret. 

Part 2:

	Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} (x592)


Part 3:

	Computer 1: csel-kh1260-02 Timing set to 200
		Part1:
			Timing:	129	375	131	343	131	127	345	127	
			Secret:	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1
		Part2:
			Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
		
	Computer 2: csel-w103-32 Timing set to 600
		Part1:
			Timing:	406	864	419	864	406	406	864	406	
			Secret:	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1
		Part2:
			Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
			
	CSE Server: csel-plate04 Timing could not be determined from Part1
		Part1:
			Timing:	90	315	300	315	300	315	300	300	
			Secret:	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	
			Interesting Results. (IntelÂ® Xeon Phi(TM) CPU 7290F)
		Part2:
			Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
			The timings in part2 for this CSE Server was more normal and secret could be found. 
			Secret was not found using Part1 Timing, but by looking at the delta times in Part2
	VOLE:
		Part1:
			Timing: 112	263	265	264	89	90	87	266
			Secret: 1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1
		Part2:
			Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
			
	Why were the times different/similar?
		Due to different amounts of server load when on same architectures, 
		and due to different architectures leading to different memory
		speeds and behaviour.
		
		The times are different/similar because of the different amounts of server load on same architectures.
		These different amounts of server load will lead to different memory speeds (and subsequently different thresholds).
		The processors for these machines also vary. For example, I believe most of the CSE machines use intel processors.
