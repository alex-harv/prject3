Part 1: <CSEL-W103-54>

	Explain your results (2-3 sentences):
	There was alot of variation in the time it would take. Expecially if the first access didnt happen.
	But by looking at the minimum time for a non-access, you could set a threshold. It was found that while non access times would often be 400-500, the lowest they would usually be seen was 350, while access times did not usually get that high.
	Calculated threshold: 350
