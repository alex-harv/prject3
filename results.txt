Part 1: <CSEL-W103-54>

	Explain your results (2-3 sentences):
	There was alot of variation in the time it would take. Expecially if the first access didnt happen.
	But by looking at the minimum time for a non-access, you could set a threshold. It was found that while non access times would often be 400-500, the lowest they would usually be seen was 350, while access times did not usually get that high.
	Calculated threshold: 350


Part 2:

	Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}


Part 3:

	Computer 1: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} csel-kh1260-02 Timing set to 900 (700 to 1100) This computer had very irregular timings. Hard to get a good result. For some reason it looks like when switching from 1 core to 2 core (part 1 to part 2) has hidden the victims accesses. 

	Computer 2: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} 

	CSE Server: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} 

	VOLE: {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}

	Why were the times different/similar?
