Part 1: <CSEL-W103-54>

	Explain your results (2-3 sentences):
	There was alot of variation in the time it would take. Expecially if the first access didnt happen.
	But by looking at the minimum time for a non-access, you could set a threshold. It was found that while non access times would often be 400-500, the lowest they would usually be seen was 350, while access times did not usually get that high.
	Calculated threshold: 350


Part 2:

	Secret Array: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}


Part 3:

	Computer 1: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} csel-kh1260-02 Timing set to 1050 

	Computer 2: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} csel-w103-32 Irregular timings. Set to print all deltas and data extracted from differences between them. 

	CSE Server: {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} csel-plate04 Timing set to 300

	VOLE:
		Timing: 112	263	265	264	89	90	87	266
		Secret: 1	0	1	0	1	1	1	1

	Why were the times different/similar?
		The caches hit and miss at different speeds, so
		this could explain why the times can be so different/similar.
